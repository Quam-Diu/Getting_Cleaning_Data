# A) Project description

This project is part of the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" from the Data Scientist Specialization on Coursera.
The objective is to apply different concepts and R packages learned during the course to a raw data set and produce a tidy data set, which could be used for posterior analysis.

# B) Study design and data processing

## B.1) Collection of the raw data

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0)

Downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

According to it's authors:

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."

I kindly recommend to watch the following video, wich shows how the data was collected. It helped me to put the data in a context instead of working with "cold" numbers, and made the project a lot meaningful.

## B.2) Notes on the original (raw) data

- Please refer to the "README.txt" file of the original dataset.
- The dataset doesn't contain missing values.
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]

## B.3) Creating the tidy datafile

An R script called "run_analysis.R" is used to create the tidy dataset from the raw data (wich is compressed in the file "UCI HAR Dataset.zip")
- This script was created using OS X 10.1.1
- This script uses de dplyr library, wich is required to be loaded before running the function getData in order to work properly.

Please note: 
- The function "unz" is used to read files from the zip without unzipping it, so the file "UCI HAR Dataset.zip" should be in your working directory. The script will download the zip file if it doesn't find it in the working directory.

Pseudocode
1- Download the zipped data file (if required).

2- Read the required files (based on the discussions on the forums of the project and my interpretation of what is required,
   there are 8 total files to be readed, the files of inertial signals are not used).
   
3- Add descriptive column names to the files (for the X_test and X_train the second column of the features.txt file is used).

4- Create one dataset for the training data and other for the test data.

5- Create one single dataset combining the training and test data.

6- Select the columns that contain "mean" and "std" (the case of each term is ignored by default by the function used). Columns with duplicated names where removed, since none of these were required by the project parameters.

7- Replace the activity numbers by its correspondant name as defined in the "activity_labels.txt" file.

8- Summarise the data (the mean of each variable, i.e. the columns selected on the step 6), by volunteer and by activity.

9- Write the summarized data into a file called "act_tidy.txt".

The expected output is a dataset with 180 rows (30 volunteers, 6 activities per volunteer) and 88 variables.

## B.4) Cleaning of the data

No further work to "clean" is done to the data, however steps 6 and 7 could be considered as "cleaning", because they are done in order to obtain a more readable and understandable dataset. There aren't any other variable transformations apart from the described in the steps 6 to 8.

# C) Description of the variables in the act_tidy.txt file

## C.1) Dimensions: 
   180 rows x 88 columns
   
## C.2) Summary:
   See file "act_tidy.txt"
   
## C.3) Variables present in the dataset
[01] subject_id
- Class: int
- Type: Categorical

- Schema: None
- Notes: None

[02] activity_label
- Class: chr
- Type: Categorical
- Unit of measurement: None
- Description: One of the six activities done by the volunteers of the experiment.
- Levels: 
   [1] WALKING
   [2] WALKING_UPSTAIRS
   [3] WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

The descriptions of variables [03] to [88] are equivalent.

[03]	tBodyAcc-mean()-X
- Class: num
- Type: Continuous, normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
- Unit of measurement: For the data obtained from the gyroscope is rads/second, for the data obtained from the acelerometer this   information is not provided
- Description: Mean of the correspondant variable of the raw data, grouped by volunteer and by activity.
- Lavels: None
- Schema: [t/f][Body/Gravity][Acc/Gyro][Jerk][Mag][mean/std][X/Y/Z]
   - prefix t denotes time, prefix f denotes frequency
   - Body denotes the part of the signal due to the body movement, Gravity denotes the part of the signal due to gravity
   - Acc denotes that the source of the signal is the acelerometer, Gyro denotes that the source of the signal is the gyroscope
   - Jerk denotes a Jerk signal (see notes)
   - Mag denotes the magnitud of the signal
   - mean denotes that the value estimated from the signals is the mean, std denotes that the value estimated from the signals is      the standard deviation
   - X, Y, Z denotes the axis of spatial movement (no further information is provided of which is which)
- Notes:
   Further explanations could be found in the "features_info.txt" of the original dataset.
   Jerk signal: A detailed explanation wasn't provided, but on further reading I found that it refers to the rate of change of      net acceleration.
