## Getting and Cleaning Data course project

Repository for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data, from Coursera

The file "run_Analysis.R" contains only one function; getData, which does all the processing required to download the raw dataset (if necesary), read the data, and write the required output to a file.

Please read the Codebook for a full explanation of the code and the output variables.

The script was made on R Studio, with OS X 10.1. Please take this into account, specially regarding possible compatibility issues  reading the raw data from the zip file (because Mac and Windows use different path separators, "/" and "\" respectively).

Regards...Tavo.
