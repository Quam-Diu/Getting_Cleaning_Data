## Getting and Cleaning Data course project

This is a repository for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data, from Coursera

The file "run_Analysis.R" contains only one function; getData, which does all the processing required to download the raw dataset (if necesary), read the data, and write the required output to a file.

The script was made on R Studio, with OS X 10.1. Please take this into account, specially regarding possible compatibility issues reading the raw data from the zip file (because Mac and Windows use different path separators, "/" and "\" respectively).

In this repository I included the act_tidy.txt, which is the expected output (as I understand it). Please read the Codebook.md for a full explanation of the code and the output variables.

I also included an image called data_map.png, which is how I understood that the original raw data from the cellphones was procesed.

Regards...Tavo.
